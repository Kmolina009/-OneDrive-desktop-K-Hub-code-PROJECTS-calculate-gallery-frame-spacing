Calculate the spaceing between a number of frames on a gallery wall.
    - Unit of measurement consist of inches
    - Gallery wall width 
    - Number of pieces - set of frames(their width and maybe their height)
    - Subtract the gallery wall by the total widths of a set of frames to get the "Wall to Frame Width Difference" 
    - Divide the "Wall to Frame Width Difference" by (number of frames + 1) 

    -What are the attriutes the frames have other than their (simplified)dimensions
